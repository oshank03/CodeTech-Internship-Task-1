# Overview of the Project

**Project: - EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)**

**Objective**

The objective of this project is to perform Eploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the data set containing population data of different age groups. The aim of this project is to track and evaluate the health status of individuals or populations over time. It contains a range of activities from real-time physiological data collection (like heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature) to the analysis of more complex health records (including patient history, lifestyle choices, and genetic information).

**Key Activities**

* **Gathering Data: -** Gathering the from the internet.
* **Checking Errors: -** Before analysing the dataset check the data set contain any missing or false values or not? 
* **Data Cleaning: -** Ensuring the dataset is free from inconsistencies and missing values.
* **Data Analysis: -** Creating visulizations to understand age distribution across the diseases and their relationship.
* **Correlation Analysis: -** Identifying correlations between age and disease.

**Technologies Used**

* **Python: -** The primary programming languages for data analysis.
* **NumPy: -** Used for numerical calculation.
* **Pandas: -** Used for data manipulation and analysis.
* **Matplotlib: -** Employed for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
* **Seaborn: -** Utilized for making statistical graphics that are informatiove and attractive.

**Key insights**

* **Identified Clusters:** Distinct patient groups based on health metrics, each with unique characteristics that provide insight into their specific health needs.
* **Personalized Health Insights:** Enhanced understanding of patient health requirements and risks, enabling tailored intervention strategies.
* **Improved Health Monitoring:** Recommendations for targeted monitoring and intervention strategies that cater to the specific needs of each cluster, leading to more effective health management and better patient outcomes.

**Observation:**

1. **Distribution of Age Groups:** The count plot shows that the ‘Senior’ category has the highest count, followed by the ‘Young’ and ‘Middle-aged’ categories. It suggests that seniors are the largest age group in this dataset.
2. **Distribution of Blood Pressure Categories:** The majority of the dataset falls under ‘Normal’ blood pressure, with fewer instances in the ‘Elevated’ and ‘Hypertension Stage 1’. ‘Hypertension Stage 2’ has the lowest count, indicating that severe hypertension is less common among the participants.
3. **Distribution of Heart Rate Categories:** Most individuals have a ‘Normal’ heart rate, with very few falling into the ‘Low’ or ‘High’ categories. It indicates that most individuals in this dataset have a heart rate that falls within the expected range.
4. **Distribution of Oxygen Saturation Categories:** Almost everyone has ‘Normal’ oxygen saturation levels, with very few instances of ‘Low’ saturation. It suggests that oxygen deprivation is not a common issue in this group.
